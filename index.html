    <h3> Projects & Research</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fully led and developed a functional and highly profitable Expert Advisor (EA) for FOREX under MetaQuotes MQL5, for automated trading.<br /> The EAs infrastructure utilizes multiple trading indicators along with a LSTM Neural Network to predict market sentiment.
        <br />Volume sentiment is done utilizing a Simple RPC along with a modified ATR trailing stop indicator for determining the appropriate position sizing parameterization.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
      Leveraged a functional Cloud-Based License Plate Recognition solution through the
      implementation of a RESTful API. <br />
      The software utilized computer vision and deep learning algorithms to determine the
      string of characters that pertain to each license plate. <br />
      The applications backend was developed with the assistance of Google Cloudâ€™s
      Compute Engine and MongoDB.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Developed a Waste Monitoring System project that aims to provide a solution involving <br />
data analytics to demonstrate IoT technology's efficacy and application in minimizing costs
and effort.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Developed SecuriQuery, an efficient and performant search engine for indexing and querying a database of financial securities and their street IDs. <br />
        SecuriQuery takes large data sets and makes them manageable by offering an easy way to search for matches on multiple street IDs siumultaneously, <br />
        and assists in presenting the most relevant information by using a prioritization algorithm after the result of the query have been gathered.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Experimented and devised prototypes to anatomize the ramification of high voltage
resonant fields of specific molecules using contemporary circuits exhibiting pulse-like
behavior.<br /> Carried out analytical instruction in the following areas: Teltron Tube electron
emissions, Amplifier Circuits, Magnetic fields in a Helmholtz coil, Microwaves,<br /> Interferometer such as
Holography & Polarization Optics.
